# Snake
#### This is a version of snake created in Python, using the turtle graphics library. The program utilises object-oriented programming in which classes are created and used but also hierarchy is used to inherit class attributes. This game also uses Python to access and edit files in order to manage the highscores of the player.

#### - The code performs the following steps:
- The snake is drawn to the screen
- The food is also drawn to the screen
- Once the collision is detected between the snake head and the food, the snake grows by a portion
- The score is kept throughout the session
- The highscore file is accessed at the start of play and upon the players death in order to keep a record of the highscore. The highscore will be saved for the players next play session as it is stored in an external txt file. 
- Once the snake head comes into contact with either the wall or the snake body, the game comes to an end and the score is displayed.
