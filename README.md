# Snake
#### This is a version of snake created in Python, using the turtle graphics library. The program utilises object-oriented programming in which classes are created and used but also hierarchy is used to inherit class attributes.

#### - The code performs the following steps:
- The snake is drawn to the screen
- The food is also drawn to the screen
- Once the collision is detected between the snake head and the food, the snake grows by a portion
- The score is kept throughout the session
- Once the snake head comes into contact with either the wall or the snake body, the game comes to an end and the score is displayed.
